Welcome to AtomCalc's documentation!
====================================

This project is supposed to be expanded and should be seen as a construction fundament.
The methods used in the code are explained in my master thesis.

The code is documented in the :ref:`modules <Modules>` section of this documentation. 
The whole python file can be accessed on the corresponding `GitHub page`_.
